 Setup and Installation
Prerequisites:
Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed and set up:
1. Android Studio: Ensure the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is installed.
2. Firebase Project: You need to set up a [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/) and enable Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google Sign-In) to integrate the sign-in functionality.
3. OSMDroid Setup: The app uses OSMDroid for map features, so make sure all permissions and configurations are properly set.

 Steps to Get Started:

 1. Clone the Repository:
First, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cattastic.git
cd cattastic
```

 2. Set Up Firebase:

To properly run the app with Firebase Authentication and other Firebase services, follow these steps:
1. Create a Firebase Project: If you don't have one, go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Enable Authentication: Enable both Email/Password and Google Sign-In authentication methods in the Firebase console under Authentication -> Sign-in methods.
3. Download `google-services.json`:
   - Go to your Firebase Project in the Firebase Console.
   - Click on the Android icon to add an Android app to your project.
   - Follow the setup steps, and download the `google-services.json` file.
   - Place the `google-services.json` file in your `app` directory.

 3. Configure OSMDroid for Maps:
The app uses OSMDroid to display cat shelter locations. Ensure that OSMDroid has access to the required permissions:

1. Open your projectâ€™s `AndroidManifest.xml` file and ensure the following permissions are included:
   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
   ```

2. If necessary, set up the tile provider for OSMDroid, using the guide from [OSMDroid Wiki](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid/wiki/How-to-use-the-osmdroid-library).

 4. Build and Run the Project:

Once the Firebase and OSMDroid configurations are set up:
1. Open the cloned project in Android Studio.
2. Sync the Gradle files to ensure all dependencies are properly downloaded.
3. Connect a physical device or set up an emulator.
4. Run the app by clicking the green play button in Android Studio.

 Automated Testing with GitHub Actions
Cattastic employs GitHub Actions for automated testing and building, ensuring that the code works across different environments, not just locally.

 GitHub Actions Overview:
- Automated Builds: Every time code is pushed to the main branch, a GitHub Action automatically triggers a build of the Android app.
- Automated Testing: Unit and integration tests run automatically to ensure key functionalities like authentication and map features work correctly.
- Continuous Integration: Ensures that each commit is tested and built, catching any potential issues early in the development process.

For more information on configuring GitHub Actions for Android, refer to the [GitHub Marketplace Actions for Android](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/automated-build-android-app-with-github-action).

---

 Version Control with GitHub
The project follows a version-controlled development process using GitHub:
1. Repository Setup: The Cattastic app was initialized with a `README.md` and properly configured for Firebase.
2. Branching Strategy: Feature branches are created for each new feature or bug fix, which are then merged into the main branch after thorough testing.
3. Commit Frequency: Commits are made regularly to document progress and ensure transparency in development.
4. Pull Requests: Code is reviewed through pull requests before being merged into the main branch to maintain code quality.
